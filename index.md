{% include image.html file="splash-image.png" max-width="1100" caption="*GranTracker* is completely free, and runs on Windows and Mac."%}

{% include note.html content="I'm a software developer, not a marketing guru, so please bear with this less-than-stunning website." %}

## The Problem

Gran Turismo 7 (GT7) gives you ***DR*** and ***SR*** ratings for **Daily Races** and such, and a hard-to-read ***DR*** progress bar:

{% include image1.html file="dr-sr.png" %}

The problem is, I can't tell how close I am to the next DR level, or how my DR/SR ratings have changed over time.

## The Solution

<h3 markdown="1">Introducing <span style="color:blue">***GranTracker***</span>, a <span style="color:blue">**free desktop application**</span> that runs on <span style="color:blue"><strong>Windows</strong></span> and <span style="color:blue"><strong>Mac</strong></span>.</h3>

<div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
	<div class="panel panel-default">
		<div class="panel-heading">
			<h4 class="panel-title">
				<a class="noCrossRef accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseOne">Why is it free? Click here if you care.</a>
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse noCrossRef">
			<div class="panel-body" style="font-size: 16px">
I'm a retired software developer who wanted something like this, and I decided to create an application I could share with other people. But charging for it has some drawbacks:

<ol>
<li>I'm retired. The last thing I want to do is start a new business.</li>
<li>People expect too much if you charge for it. To be honest, even though I'm pretty good at what I do, <b><i>GranTracker</i></b> will have some initial growing pains as people use it on different systems and in different ways.</li>
</ol>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

***GranTracker*** lets you keep stats on every race, with color-coding, so you can keep an eye on your stats and trends:
{% include image1.html file="grid-1.png" %}

You can view your DR progress over time in chart form:
{% include image1.html file="chart-1.png" %}

And include your SR progress, if you want:
{% include image1.html file="chart-2.png" %}

*GranTracker* even has animated track maps:
{% include inline_image1.html file="map-1.png" %}
<div class="my_group-clear-after" style="margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 40px" markdown="1">
<p>In the application, the red ball moves around the track.</p>
<p>I could probably make it work in this web page also,<br/>but I'd rather spend my time on other things.</p>
</div>

...which you can expand to get more detail:
{% include image1.html file="map-2.png" %}

NOTE: I haven't finished all the maps. But I hope to, over time.
