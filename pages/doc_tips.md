Version 1.1.0 of ***GranTracker*** gives you the ability to add Daily Races for additional letters, so you're not limited to just "A", "B", and "C". Version 1.1.1 expanded on that, allowing you to enter a description for the aforementioned Daily Races.

Use the additional letters for other races, like Manufacturers Cup races.
