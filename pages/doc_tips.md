## Tips

{% include accordion_panel_begin.html expanded=true first=true groupId="tips_00" panelId="tip_01" title='Adding Manufacturers Cups Races (and other race types)' %}

Version 1.1.0 of ***GranTracker*** gives you the ability to add Daily Races for additional letters, so you're not limited to just "A", "B", and "C".

Use the additional letters for other races, like Manufacturers Cup races.

This isn't the perfect solution, because you'll have to remember what the letters stand for, but at least it lets you keep the racing stats so you can track your DR, etc.
