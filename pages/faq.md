The best place to get help is in the dedicated thread at **[GTPlanet](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/official-grantracker-thread.420003/)**.

You can also use the "Contact Me" link above, but I'd prefer it if you use the GTPlanet thread, so anyone else who might have the same problem can benefit from your question(s).

{% include accordion_panel_begin.html groupId="faq_00" panelId="faq_02" title='Problems Importing a Screenshot' %}

One of my users encountered a problem which has a simple solution, but I'm not sure how to describe it. So please bear with me. And if you can think of a better way of describing this, let me know.

The issue was that the program crashed either when importing the image, or when he tried to save the race - I'm not clear on which. I'll fix the crashing issue, but here's what caused it:

Compare these two screenshots:

![](images/faq_01_02.png)

In the second image, notice how the Profile screen doesn't completely fill the image?

Here's the solution, directly from the user (slightly edited for clarity). This is on a PS4, so I don't know if it's different on a PS5:

> I didn't once think about that black frame. It's only there in menus, not actual racing.
>
>I found the fullscreen option in the PS4 main menu -> (Settings) > [Sound and Screen] > [Display Area Settings] ("This setting is effective only for some applications.")
>
>Now it works, thank you!

Many thanks to "Kamikatze" for his help.
