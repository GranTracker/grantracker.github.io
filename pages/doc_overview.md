1. **[Application Menu](doc_app_menu.html)**. Don't forget that it's here. It has a few things you can't do anywhere else.
2. **[Accounts Dropdown](doc_accounts.html)**. You can store race info for multiple accounts.
3. **Tabs**. Allows you to look at different ***GranTracker*** "screens".
4. **Tab Screen Area**. When you click on a tab, its screen appears here.
5. **Import Race from Screenshot**. Click this to start importing a screenshot. You *may* also be able to drop a file on ***GranTracker*** to start the import. This should work for Macs, but I was having trouble getting it to work on Windows.
6. **Options**.
