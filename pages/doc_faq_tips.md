## FAQ

{% include accordion_panel_begin.html first=true groupId="faq_00" panelId="faq_01" title='Problems Importing a Screenshot' %}

One of my users encountered a problem which has a simple solution, but I'm not sure how to describe it. So please bear with me. And if you can think of a better way of describing this, let me know.

The issue was that the program crashed either when importing the image, or when he tried to save the race - I'm not clear on which. I'll fix the crashing issue, but here's what caused it:

Compare these two screenshots:

![](images/faq_01_02.png)

In the second image, notice how the Profile screen doesn't completely fill the image?

Here's the solution, directly from the user (slightly edited for clarity). This is on a PS4, so I don't know if it's different on a PS5:

> I didn't once think about that black frame. It's only there in menus, not actual racing.
>
>I found the fullscreen option in the PS4 main menu -> (Settings) > [Sound and Screen] > [Display Area Settings] ("This setting is effective only for some applications.")
>
>Now it works, thank you!

Many thanks to "Kamikatze" for his help.

## Tips

{% include accordion_panel_begin.html first=true groupId="tips_00" panelId="tip_01" title='Adding Manufacturers Cups Races (and other race types)' %}

Version 1.1.0 of ***GranTracker*** gives you the ability to add Daily Races for additional letters, so you're not limited to just "A", "B", and "C".

Use the additional letters for other races, like Manufacturers Cup races.

This isn't the perfect solution, because you'll have to remember what the letters stand for, but at least it lets you keep the racing stats so you can track your DR, etc.

Now when you import a new race, you have the additional letters to choose from:
