## Purpose

A lot of people like to use multiple PSN accounts when racing. The reasons vary, but usually it's because they don't want to chance ruining their DR and/or SR in a free-for-all type of race.

***GranTracker*** supports this, allowing you to add multiple accounts so you can keep track of each account's DR/SR separately:

## Renaming the Primary Account

The first thing you'll probably want to do is rename the "Primary" account. So click the drop-down, and select `Add/Edit Accounts`:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_02.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

Select the Primary account and click the "Pencil" icon, or just double-click the Primary account:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_03.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

Enter your PSN and Racing Name:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_04.png" %}

You can name these whatever you want - it's only to help you keep track of each account. They don't have to match your real PSN account or Racing Name. <span style="color:blue"><strong>Don't worry about "Color Set" for right now</strong></span> - just leave it at "Default".

Click "OK", and the Primary account has been changed to your preference:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_05.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

Then click "Done", and the Account drop-down changes to the Racing Name you entered:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_06.png" %}

<hr class="normal"/>

## Creating a Second Account

How to create a second account should be fairly obvious now, but here it is in a nutshell.

In the Add/Edit Account screen, click the "plus" button:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_10.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

Fill in the information:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_11.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

Click OK:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_12.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

And now you can select your second account:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_13.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_14.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

## Using Color Sets

The next time ***GranTracker** starts up, it uses the same account that you last selected, because that's what you will typically want.

But then you run a race under your Primary account, and you forget to change the account in ***GranTracker***, and add the race info to the wrong account.

That's what **Color Sets** are meant to help prevent.

Remember that thing I told you we'd talk about later? Well here it is:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_15.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

As of the time I'm writing this, ***GranTracker*** comes with 2 different color sets ("default" and "black"), and I'll show you how to add a third (blue) in a moment:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_16.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

And they make it glaringly obvious that you're not using your primary account:

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_17.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

{% include image1.html file="doc/accounts/accounts_18.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px !important" %}

Note that these are not meant to be "themes", nor is the black one meant to be "Dark Mode". They only change a few colors. But the impact is pretty obvious.

I don't currently have a way for you to edit these color sets, however, [**you can add or edit them manually**](doc_tips.html#tip_02) (this link shows how to add the "Blue" color set).
