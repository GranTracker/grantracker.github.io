### The Big Change: Time Zones are now take into account.

* This means that the Start Date/Time of each Daily Race Week is adjusted for your time zone.
  * Polyphony Digital puts the new races up on Monday 07:00 am UTC.
  * Starting with this version, ***GranTracker*** adjusts the the start of each race week to match the time zone you live in.
  * So, for example, for people who live in Germany, the new races start on Monday at 8am (I think that's right, but it doesn't matter because ***GranTracker*** is better at calculating time zone differences than I am.)

* <span style="color:red; font-size: 120%"><strong>Because of this, changes were made to the format of the Data Files.</strong></span>
  * Your data will be updated seamlessly in the background, the first time you run the new version.
  * Which means that once you run this updated version, you can't run a previous version against your updated data.
  * So if you have ***GranTracker*** on multiple computers, sharing data files, make sure you update ***GranTracker** on all of them.

### Other Changes/Bug Fixes

* Resizing the main window of ***GranTracker*** should now work much better. In previous versions, if you made the window too small, you'd lose the top and/or bottom of the window. Resizing the window is much improved now, although I'm sure you can still cause problems if you make it too small.

* You can now import screen shot files with the extension of ".jpeg".
